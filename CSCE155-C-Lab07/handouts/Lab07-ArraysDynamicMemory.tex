\section*{Prior to Lab}

Before attending this lab:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Read and familiarize yourself with this handout.
  \item Review the following free textbook resources:
	\begin{itemize}
  	  \item \url{http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node7.html} 
	  \item \url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Arrays}
	  \item \url{http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node11.html}
	  \item \url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Memory_management}
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Peer Programming Pair-Up}

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs will be
structured in a \emph{pair programming} setup.  At the start of
each lab, you will be randomly paired up with another student 
(conflicts such as absences will be dealt with by the lab instructor).
One of you will be designated the \emph{driver} and the other
the \emph{navigator}.  

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions and
telling the driver what to do next.  The driver will be in charge of the
keyboard and workstation.  Both driver and navigator are responsible
for suggesting fixes and solutions together.  Neither the navigator
nor the driver is ``in charge.''  Beyond your immediate pairing, you
are encouraged to help and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should alternate: if you were a driver last week, 
be a navigator next, etc.  Resolve any issues (you were both drivers
last week) within your pair.  Ask the lab instructor to resolve issues
only when you cannot come to a consensus.  

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely 
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab.  Failure to do
so will negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with 
others which may mean that you will not be able to complete the
lab.  

\section{Lab Objectives \& Topics}
At the end of this lab you should be familiar with the following
\begin{itemize}
  \item Understand what memory leaks are, how they're caused, 
  	and how to prevent them
  \item Declare and fill an array with values
  \item Access an array's values individually and iterate over the entire array
  \item Pass an array as a parameter to a function
  \item Understand the relationship between arrays and pointers
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}

Arrays hold collections of variable values of a certain type 
(\mintinline{c}{int} or \mintinline{c}{double} for example).
Static arrays are arrays whose size is specified at compile 
time and specified by hardcoding the size when declared.  
For example:

\mintinline{c}{int array[100];}

This declares an integer array that holds 100 integers (in 
addition, static arrays are allocated on the program stack 
while dynamic arrays are allocated on the program heap, 
but we will not go into those details here).  Once we have 
an array, we can access individual elements in the array by 
specifying an index:

\begin{minted}{c}
array[0] = 5;
printf("the last element is %d\n", array[99]);
\end{minted}

You should take care that you do not access elements beyond 
the range of the array's indices.  Indices start at 0 (first element) 
and end one less than the size of the array.  Attempts to access 
elements outside this range results in undefined behavior and 
may result in a segmentation fault or other such run time error.

Unfortunately, static arrays are quite limited and for most applications, 
we will not know how big an array needs to be at compile time.  
Instead, we typically need an array whose size is not known until 
runtime.  Dynamic arrays provide such functionality.

Dynamic arrays are arrays whose size is not specified at compile 
time.  Rather, we write code such that at run time, a chunk of 
memory is dynamically allocated to accommodate the space we 
need to hold a certain number of variable values.  C provides a 
family of functions to dynamically allocate memory in the standard 
C library (\mintinline{text}{stdlib.h}): \mintinline{c}{malloc()}, 
\mintinline{c}{calloc()} and \mintinline{c}{realloc()}.  

In this lab, we will focus on malloc (memory allocation), which takes 
exactly one argument: the number of bytes you wish to allocate in 
memory.  To make our code portable, we do not hardcode the number 
of bytes each type of variable requires.  Instead, we use the 
\mintinline{c}{sizeof} operator to determine how many bytes each 
type takes.  Finally, \mintinline{c}{malloc} returns a generic void 
pointer (\mintinline{c}{void *}) because as far as \mintinline{c}{malloc} 
is concerned, it is just allocating memory, it doesn't care what you 
intend to use it for.  Therefore, it is best practice to explicitly type 
case the void pointer into the type of pointer that we intend to use 
it as.  Altogether, we have:

\mintinline{c}{int *arr = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int) * 100);}

This creates an array that is holds 100 integers.  Once allocated, 
we can treat the array like any other static array with indices 
starting at 0 just as before.

Memory is a resource and when using dynamic memory, memory 
management becomes an issue.  Memory management means 
that we responsibly ``clean up'' after ourselves.  Once the dynamic 
memory that was allocated is no longer needed, we need to tell 
the operating system that we're done with it and that it should be 
made available to be reused by our program or allow other 
programs to use it.  We release memory by using the \mintinline{c}{free()} 
function and passing it a pointer to our memory chunk:

\mintinline{c}{free(arr);}

Failure to release unneeded memory may result in a memory leak 
whereby a program continually allocates memory but never releases 
it, becoming a resource hog.  Eventually, the program uses so much 
memory that it slows  to a halt or is terminated as the operating 
system is unable or unwilling to allocate more resources to it.

\subsection{Fixing a Memory Leak}

In this exercise, we'll observe a memory leak in action and fix it.

\subsubsection*{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Change to the \mintinline{text}{memoryLeak} directory
  \item Build the executable using the \mintinline{text}{make} command.  
  	Make is a utility that reads a makefile--a specification for source file 
	dependencies and the process by which they are built.  The makefile 
	for this project has been provided for you.
  \item A program named \mintinline{text}{memLeak} will be created in your 
	directory.  The program will generate an array of 500,000 integers 
	using \mintinline{c}{malloc()} several times (the exact number is specified 
	by the user as a command line argument).  It will then find a random 
	$i$th Order Element and print the result to the screen.  
  \item Open a second putty session (right click the putty icon on the task bar), 
	and run the command \mintinline{text}{top -u login} where \mintinline{text}{login}
	is replaced with your cse login.  This will open up a list of all of the 
	processes currently being executed by you.  
  \item In the first putty session, run the \mintinline{text}{memLeak} program 
	and generate 40 different random lists by running \mintinline{text}{./memLeak 40}
	(this may take some time).  
  \item In the second putty session (the one running top), pay close attention 
	to the \mintinline{text}{memLeak} program, specifically the column labeled ``RES''.  
	This column will tell you the current amount of memory being used by a 
	specific process.  
  \item Keep track of how much memory it uses towards the end of its 
	execution on your worksheet.  
  \item Once the program is done, navigate to the \mintinline{text}{src} 
	directory and open the file \mintinline{text}{memLeak.c}.  Fix the memory 
	leak by adding a call to \mintinline{c}{free()} in the appropriate place 
	(hint: it will be inside the loop in the \mintinline{text}{main()} function).  
  \item Repeat steps 6--8.  Close top by typing `q'
  \item Finish questions 1 and 2 on your worksheet
\end{enumerate}
  
\subsection{Static Arrays}

Navigate back to the statistics directory.  Several files have been 
provided for you.  The \mintinline{text}{stats.c} and \mintinline{text}{stats.h} 
file define several utility functions to manipulate arrays and to 
compute statistics on those arrays.  The \mintinline{text}{statsMain.c} 
file contains a main driver program.  Recall that you will compile 
these files using:

\begin{minted}{text}
gcc -c stats.c
gcc -o runStats stats.o statsMain.c
\end{minted}

In this activity, you will implement and use several functions that use 
arrays as parameters.  When passed as a parameter to a function, 
the function also needs to be told how large the array is; typically an 
integer size variable is passed with any array parameter.  You will also 
declare and populate a static array to test your functions.

\subsubsection*{Instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A function, \mintinline{c}{readInArray} has been provided for you 
	that takes an array and its size and prompts the user to enter values 
	to populate the array.  However, there is an error in the function: 
	examine the \mintinline{c}{scanf} call and determine what is wrong 
	and fix it before proceeding.
  \item Using the other functions as a reference, implement the 
	\mintinline{c}{getMin}, \mintinline{c}{getMax}, and \mintinline{c}{getMean} 
	functions.  You will need to provide the correct function signature 
	in both the header file and source file.
  \item In the \mintinline{text}{statsMain.c} declare a static array that is 
	``large enough'' as indicated by the other clues in the code.  Use your 
	declared static array as an argument to \mintinline{c}{readInArray} 
	and the other function calls.
  \item Run your program and demonstrate it to a lab instructor.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dynamic Arrays}

In this activity you will modify the code in \mintinline{text}{statsMain.c} to 
use a dynamic array instead of a static array.

\subsubsection*{Instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Alter your static array declaration to be an integer pointer and add 
	code that calls malloc to initialize the appropriate amount of memory.
  \item Alter any other code as necessary to remove the ``large enough'' 
	restriction that we had in the previous activity.
  \item Run your program again and demonstrate it to a lab instructor
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsubsection*{Follow Up}

Demonstrate your program using a ``large'' array.  Obviously prompting 
for and entering a lot of numbers is tedious.  So instead, alter your code 
again to instead take advantage of the \mintinline{c}{createRandomArray} 
function provided for you.  Demonstrate it to a lab instructor and have 
them sign your lab worksheet. 

\section{Advanced Activity (Optional)}

So far we've only been working with single dimensional arrays, but often 
times it is important to represent something like a table or a matrix in 
code.  One way to accomplish this is to use a multidimensional array.  
You can declare a statically allocated 2D array with the statement 

\mintinline{c}{int matrix[100][50];}

You can think of 100 as the number of rows in the table and 50 as the 
number of columns.  Begin by writing a program that will initialize a 
matrix with some random numbers and find the average of each row 
(you'll probably want to use nested for loops).  Once you've gotten 
the hang of accessing the elements in a 2D matrix, try writing a 
program that will find the product of two (square) matrices.  To assist 
you, write a function that will automatically create a randomly 
populated two dimensional array and return a reference to it (a 
pointer to a pointer array!).
